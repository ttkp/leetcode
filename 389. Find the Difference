Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
       int i,ans=0;
       for(i=0;i<s.size();i++){
           ans^=s[i]-'a';
       }
       for(i=0;i<t.size();i++){
           ans^=t[i]-'a';
       }
       return ans+'a';
    }
};
